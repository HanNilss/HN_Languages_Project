            <p class="subheader">Creator:</p>
                <p>Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto</p>
            <p class="subheader">History:</p>
                <p>The idea for Ruby was conceived by Matz in the mid 1990's to take the best parts of the most popular programming languages at the time. After it's initial release in 1995, it didn't get popular until 2006, when it has since become massive language with global users. One of the biggest reasons for Ruby's success was its web development frameword "Ruby on Rails", which revolutionized how web development was done.</p>
            <p class="subheader">Use</p>
                <p>Ruby is a relatively user friendly and intuitive programming language designed for both front- and back-end web development and similar tasks. It is a scripting language with a balance of functional and imperative programming, and as well as being easy to understand, it is very versitile. This means that hatever you are programming, it can be done on many different operating systems. </p>
            <p class="subheader">Current state: </p>
                <p>Today, Ruby is used both in web development and other uses. Some of the more popular applications created with Ruby include Airbnb, HULU, and MyFitnessPal.</p>
