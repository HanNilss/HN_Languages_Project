            <p class="subheader">Creator:</p>
                <p>Graydon Hoare</p>
            <p class="subheader">History:</p>
                <p>Rust was originally created to solve a software related problem that the creator, Graydon Hoarde, was experiencing in his home. Instead of complaining to get it fixed, he created his own program that would go on to be known as Rust. He wanted it to be robust and without bugs. Since then, Rust has grown to be one of the most beloved programming languages in the world with many big corporations utilizing its safe nature and fast speed. </p>
            <p class="subheader">Use</p>
                <p>Rust is a general-purpose language but works best in specific cases. Firstly, it excels in networking and embedded devices. This is because one of the reasons for Rust's development was to make it suitable for operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems. Rusts also shine when it comes to web development, both on the front-end and back-end. Rust is also suitable for building command-line tools.</p>
            <p class="subheader">Current state: </p>
                <p>Today, Rust is one of the most beloved programming languages, with almost 3 million users. Big companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cloudflare and smaller applications such as Discord and Dropbox use it and regard it as their future in programming.</p>
