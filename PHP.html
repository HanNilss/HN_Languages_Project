            <p>Rasmus Lerdorf</p>
        <p class="subheader">History:</p>
            <p>The program was initially used privately by Rasmus Lerdorf to keep track of how many people had looked at his online resume. Developed into a simple tool called "Personal Home Page Tools" and could be used by people who had their own home pages online. Later, PHP was combined with another package that Lerdorf had worked on called Form Interpreter and PHP turned into PHP/FI, an open source package and grew bigger year by year. In 1997, the project became more organized and started to be run by a team rather than just Lerdorf. Today PHP is used all over the web, almost 80% of websites use it, and websites such as Facebook and Wikipeda utilize it.</p>
        <p class="subheader">Use</p>
            <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language, which means it is an interpretative language that, in short, executes instructions and the server provides data on request. It then organizes the information in a database. PHP can be used to customize sites, to make synamic changes to website content, and accessing data bases. It can even be used to develop web applications. The program is also easy to use, and open source, which is why it is so widespread across the web.</p>
        <p class="subheader">Current state: </p>
            <p>Today PHP is used on almost 80% of all websites on the internet, and major examples include Facebook and Wikipedia. </p>
