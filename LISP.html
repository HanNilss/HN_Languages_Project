            <p class="subheader">History:</p>
                <p>LISP is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today, only a bit younger than FORTRAN. It was concieved by John McCarthy, a computer scientist at M.I.T., in 1958 and is based on lambda-calculus. It has over the years come to be associated with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <p class="subheader">Use</p>
                <p>LISP is a functional programming language that has many uses. Originally designed for Artificall Intelligence, it can be used do create many different programs, but it excells in self learning programs because of its recursive nature.</p>
            <p class="subheader">Current state: </p>
                <p>Today LISP is used in many ways, and despite its old age it is still used in modern ways. It is for example used in aircraft controls and the writing tool Grammrly.</p>
